### Damage Proxy Maps based on Coherence Change Detection.

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE) 

This module provides a fully-automated workflow for the creation of Damage Proxy Maps based on the method of Coherent Change Detection (CCD) with Sentinel-1 SLC data as described by [Tay et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0443-5). 

The output data files consist of the Damage Proxy Map as GeoTiff (*dmp_...tif*) and KMZ (*dmp_...kmz*) file, as well as the raw CCD values in GeoTiff (*CCD_...tif*) and GeoJSON (*CCD_...geojson*) format. 

The files are found within a **newly created folder**. The folder name is based on the name of your AOI file and the event date. 

### Minimum requirements:

- **m16 instance** (16 CPU and 64 GB RAM)
- **50 GB of free disk space**
